For this exercise, let’s assume that your teammate has already pushed up their branch to Github and they made a pull request. Thankfully, all we need to know is the name of their branch in order to pull it down and check it out for ourselves. Your teammate has been working on styling the page and has made a few changes to the css file, his branch is called JohnStyling. We have been working on a branch of our own for a while, so we’ll need to checkout to a new branch to take a look at John’s work.",
                    "instructions": "To avoid any conflicts and to keep things simple. I recommend testing in a new branch with the same name as your teammates branch. I find it easier to keep things organized this way. Before we create a new branch, let’s save our work. Go ahead and add add and commit your work. Don't forget a log message when you commit",
